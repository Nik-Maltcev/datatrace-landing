# Response fields

### Description

InfoTrackPeople is currently on a stage of moving from version 1 to version 2.
Thus, currently results from both versions will be returned on [search](https://itp-docs.pages.dev/endpoints/search/)

Because of not all sources were fully moved from v1 to v2, results are mixed from two versions. You may
check detailed description of fields that are returned by each version in [v1](https://itp-docs.pages.dev/endpoints/v1_fields/) and [v2](https://itp-docs.pages.dev/endpoints/v2_fields/)

Current flow can be represented this way.
